      <p>
        Your credibility score reflects how consistently you
        meet your commitments and how your proofs are verified
        by peers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your verifier trust score reflects how often your
        verification decisions align with the final outcome.

      <p>
        These scores are not opinions. They are the result of
        recorded actions and system-enforced rules.
